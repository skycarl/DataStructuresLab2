This program solves the Towers of Hanoi problem recursively and iteratively. It prints the moves as well as summary statistics to an output file.

Warning: it is not recommended to run this for greater than approximately 20 disks as it will take a considerable amount of time to run and will generate a very large output file.

The input file must contain an integer indicating the maximum number of disks to be solved. To run, specify input file and output file names as runtime parameters. For example:

javac Lab2.java
java Lab2 ProblemSize.txt output.txt
